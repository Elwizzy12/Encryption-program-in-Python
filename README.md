# Encryption-program-in-Python
This Python program demonstrates a basic encryption and decryption process using a simple substitution cipher. It allows you to encrypt a message by randomly shuffling the characters and then decrypt the encrypted message back to its original form.
# Installation Requirements
Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

# Getting Started
 ### 1. Clone the Repository
`$ git clone git@github.com:Elwizzy12/Encryption-program-in-Python.git`
` $ cd Encryption-program-in-Python`
 
 ### Run the Program
`$ python3 main.py`

# Usage
## 1. Encryption:

Enter a message to encrypt when prompted.
The program will generate a random key by shuffling the available characters.
Each character of the input message will be replaced by the corresponding character from the key.
The encrypted message will be displayed.

## 2. Decryption:

Enter an encrypted message to decrypt when prompted.
The program will use the generated key to reverse the encryption process.
Each character of the encrypted message will be replaced by the corresponding character from the original characters.
The decrypted message will be displayed.
